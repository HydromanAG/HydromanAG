### Ayush Garg - @HydromanAG


Hi, I'm Ayush Garg, a sophomore at IIT Delhi doing my major in Mathematics and Computing with a minor in Economics. I'm currently working on affine convex geometries and their representations on the plane. In my free time, I mostly do machine learning along with a bit of development. I along with a bunch of my classmates made an app, that currently has 100+ Downloads on the Google Play Store. I wish I could tell you more about the code, but it's still in stealth modeðŸ¤”. 
The repo is private and we hope to make it public soon.
